Programming language used: Java

How is the code structured:
The code is structured mostly in similar way like the startup code files given to us (maxconnect4.java, GameBoard.java and AiPlayer.java)
A few changes have been made in the GameBoard file to speed up score counting.
AiPlayer contains the minimax with alpha beta and depth limited implementation.

How to run the code:
First compile the .java file using the following command,
javac maxconnect4.java

Then to run the program use the following command(s) making sure that the .java file and the input text file are in the same folder
Eg1: java maxconnect4 interactive input1.txt [computer-next/human-next] [depth]
Eg2: java maxconnect4 interactive input1.txt computer-next/human-next 6
Eg3: java maxconnect4 one-move input1.txt output1.txt 6
